The Great Gatsby,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby_(1926_film),, ,"Fitzgerald began outlining his third novel in June 1922. He longed to produce an exquisite work that was beautiful and intricately patterned, but the troubled production of his stage play The Vegetable repeatedly interrupted his progress. The play flopped, and Fitzgerald wrote magazine stories that winter to pay debts incurred by its production. He viewed these stories as all worthless, although included among them was ""Winter Dreams"", which Fitzgerald described as his first attempt at the Gatsby idea. ""The whole idea of Gatsby"", he later explained to a friend, ""is the unfairness of a poor young man not being able to marry a girl with money. This theme comes up again and again because I lived it"".
In October 1922, after the birth of their only child, Frances Scott ""Scottie"" Fitzgerald, the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck, New York, on Long Island. Their neighbors in Great Neck included such newly wealthy personages as writer Ring Lardner, actor Lew Fields and comedian Ed Wynn. These figures were all considered to be nouveau riche, unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck, which sat across the bay from Great Neck—places that were home to many of New York's wealthiest established families. This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for ""West Egg"" and ""East Egg"". In the novel, Great Neck (Kings Point) became the ""new money"" peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington (Sands Point) became the ""old money"" East Egg. Several Gold Coast mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby's estate including Land's End, Oheka Castle, and the since-demolished Beacon Towers.
While living on Long Island, the Fitzgeralds' enigmatic neighbor was Max Gerlach. Purportedly born in America to a German immigrant family, Gerlach had been a major in the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I, and he later became a gentleman bootlegger who lived like a millionaire in New York. Flaunting his new wealth, Gerlach threw lavish parties, never wore the same shirt twice, used the phrase ""old sport"", and fostered myths about himself, including that he was a relation of the German Kaiser. These details about Gerlach inspired Fitzgerald in his creation of Jay Gatsby.
During this same time period, the daily newspapers sensationalized the Hall–Mills murder case over many months, and the highly publicized case likely influenced the plot of Fitzgerald's novel. The case involved the double-murder of a man and his lover on September 14, 1922, mere weeks before Fitzgerald arrived in Great Neck. Scholars have speculated that Fitzgerald based certain aspects of the ending of The Great Gatsby and various characterizations on this factual incident.
Inspired by the Hall–Mills case, the mysterious persona of Gerlach and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island, Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel by mid-1923, but discarded most of his new story as a false start. Some of this early draft resurfaced in the 1924 short story ""Absolution"". In earlier drafts, Daisy was originally named Ada and Nick was Dud, and the two characters had shared a previous romance prior to their reunion on Long Island. These earlier drafts were written from the viewpoint of an omniscient narrator as opposed to Nick's perspective. A key difference in earlier drafts is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream. Another difference is that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Gatsby is more balanced, although Daisy still returns to Tom.
Work on The Great Gatsby resumed in earnest in April 1924. Fitzgerald decided to depart from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that he was intent on creating an artistic achievement. He wished to eschew the realism of his previous two novels and to compose a creative work of sustained imagination. To this end, he consciously imitated the literary styles of Joseph Conrad and Willa Cather. He was particularly influenced by Cather's 1923 work, A Lost Lady, which features a wealthy married socialite pursued by a variety of romantic suitors and who symbolically embodies the American dream. He later wrote a letter to Cather apologizing for any unintentional plagiarism. During this period of revisions, Scott saw and was influenced by early sketches for the book's dust jacket art. Soon after this burst of effort, work slowed while the Fitzgeralds moved to the Villa Marie in Saint-Raphaël on the French Riviera, where a marital crisis soon developed.
Despite his ongoing marital tension, Fitzgerald continued to write steadily and submitted a near-final version of the manuscript to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, on October 27. Perkins informed him in a November letter that Gatsby was too vague as a character and that his wealth and business, respectively, needed a convincing explanation. Fitzgerald thanked Perkins for his detailed criticisms and claimed that such feedback would enable him to perfect the manuscript. Having relocated with his wife to Rome, Fitzgerald made revisions to the manuscript throughout the winter.
Content after a few rounds of revision, Fitzgerald submitted the final version in February 1925. Fitzgerald's alterations included extensive revisions of the sixth and eighth chapters. He declined an offer of $10,000 for the serial rights to the book so that it could be published sooner. He received a $3,939 advance in 1923 and would receive $1,981.25 upon publication.  "

The Godfather,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather,"Coppola hired Italian composer Nino Rota to create the underscore for the film, including ""Love Theme from The Godfather"". For the score, Rota was to relate to the situations and characters in the film. Rota synthesized new music for the film and took some parts from his 1958 Fortunella film score, to create an Italian feel and evoke the tragedy within the film. Paramount executive Evans found the score to be too ""highbrow"" and did not want to use it; however, it was used after Coppola managed to get Evans to agree. Coppola believed that Rota's musical piece gave the film even more of an Italian feel. Coppola's father, Carmine, created some additional music for the film, particularly the music played by the band during the opening wedding scene.
Incidental music includes ""C'è la luna mezzo mare"", Cherubino's aria, ""Non so più cosa son"", from Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro and ""Brindisi"", from Verdi's La traviata. There was a soundtrack released for the film in 1972 in vinyl form by Paramount Records, on CD in 1991 by Geffen Records, and digitally by Geffen on August 18, 2005. The album contains over 31 minutes of music that was used in the film, most of which was composed by Rota, along with a song from Coppola and one by Johnny Farrow and Marty Symes. AllMusic gave the album five out of five, with editor Zach Curd saying it is a ""dark, looming, and elegant soundtrack"". An editor for Filmtracks believed that Rota was successful in relating the music to the film's core aspects. Bach's Prelude and Fugue in D major, BWV 532 and Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582 are played during the baptism scene. "," The Godfather was nominated for seven awards at the 30th Golden Globe Awards: Best Picture – Drama, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando for Best Actor – Drama, James Caan for Best Supporting Actor, Best Score, Best Director, and Best Screenplay, winning for: Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actor – Drama (Brando), Best Original Score, and Best Picture – Drama.
Rota's score was also nominated for Grammy Award for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture or TV Special at the 15th Grammy Awards. Rota was announced the winner of the category on March 3 at the Grammys' ceremony in Nashville, Tennessee.
When the nominations for the 45th Academy Awards were revealed on February 12, 1973, The Godfather was nominated for eleven awards. The nominations were for: Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Marlon Brando for Best Actor, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for Best Adapted Screenplay, Pacino, Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, Best Film Editing, Nino Rota for Best Original Score, Coppola for Best Director, and Best Sound. Upon further review of Rota's love theme from The Godfather, the academy found that Rota had used a similar score in Eduardo De Filippo's 1958 comedy Fortunella. This led to re-balloting, where members of the music branch chose from six films: The Godfather and the five films that had been on the shortlist for best original dramatic score but did not get nominated. John Addison's score for Sleuth won this new vote, and thus replaced Rota's score on the official list of nominees. Going into the awards ceremony, The Godfather was seen as the favorite to take home the most awards. From the nominations that The Godfather had remaining, it only won three of the Academy Awards: Best Actor for Brando, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture.
Brando, who did not attend the Golden Globes ceremony two months earlier, boycotted the Academy Awards ceremony and declined the Oscar, becoming the second actor to decline a Best Actor award after George C. Scott in 1971. Brando sent American Indian Rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather in his place, to announce at the awards podium Brando's reasons for declining the award, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television. Pacino also did not attend the ceremony; he was allegedly insulted at being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, when he had more screen time than his co-star and Best Actor-winner Brando, and thus should have received the nomination for Best Actor. Pacino denies this, saying in his memoir, Sonny Boy, that he was ""scared"" of his sudden fame and never heard the rumor until much later in his life.
The Godfather had five nominations for awards at the 26th British Academy Film Awards. The nominees were: Pacino for Most Promising Newcomer, Rota for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, and Brando for Best Actor, the film's costume designer Anna Hill Johnstone for Best Costume Design. The only nomination to win was that of Rota. ",

The Empire Strikes Back,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back,, ,"   The Empire Strikes Back was adapted into a 1982 radio play broadcast on National Public Radio in the United States. Return of the Jedi was released in 1983, concluding the original film trilogy. Jedi's plot follows the Rebel assault on the Empire and Luke's final confrontation with Vader and the Emperor. Like the previous films, Jedi was a financial success and fared well with critics.
Nearly two decades after the release of Empire, Lucas wrote and directed the prequel trilogy, consisting of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). The films chronicle the history between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and the latter's fall to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader. The storylines and certain new characters in the prequel films polarized critics and fans. After Lucas sold the Star Wars franchise to the Walt Disney Company in 2012, Disney developed a sequel trilogy, consisting of The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Original trilogy cast members—including Ford, Hamill, and Fisher—reprised their roles, and were joined by new characters portrayed by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Oscar Isaac. Standalone films and television series have also been released, with narratives relating to the story arcs of the original trilogy. "

Return of the Jedi,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi,"John Williams composed the film's musical score and performed it with the London Symphony Orchestra. Orchestration credits also include Thomas Newman. The initial release of the film's soundtrack was on the RSO Records label in the United States. In 2004, Sony Classical Records acquired the rights to both the original trilogy scores and to the soundtracks for the prequel films The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. In the same year, Sony Classical re-pressed the 1997 RCA Victor release of Return of the Jedi along with the other two films in the trilogy. This set was released with new artwork mirroring the first DVD release of the film. Despite the digital re-mastering, which minimally improved the sound heard only on high-end stereos, the 2004 release has been described as essentially the same as the 1997 RCA Victor release. ", ," Return of the Jedi was released on May 25, 1983. It was originally slated to open on May 27, but was subsequently changed to coincide with the date of the 1977 release of the original Star Wars film. With a massive worldwide marketing campaign, illustrator Tim Reamer created the image for the theatrical poster and other advertising. At the time of its release, the film was advertised on posters and merchandise as simply Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, despite its on-screen ""Episode VI"" distinction. The film was re-released in 1985.  "
The Terminator,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator,,," Orion Pictures did not have faith in The Terminator performing well at the box office and feared a negative critical reception. At an early screening of the film, the actors' agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics. Orion only held one press screening for the film. The film premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one at the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God! You Devil. Cameron noted that The Terminator was a hit ""relative to its market, which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters. But it's better to be a big fish in a small pond than the other way around."" The Terminator grossed $38.3 million in the United States and Canada and $40 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $78.3 million.  "
Back to the Future,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future,, ,"   A sequel was not initially planned, and the teaser ending of Doc, Marty, and Jennifer flying off in the DeLorean suggested their adventures would continue off-screen. Universal Pictures was eager to pursue a sequel based on the significant financial and critical success of Back to the Future. However, Zemeckis and Gale were reluctant to participate, believing sequels often retread the best elements of the original film. They were also concerned that a poor follow-up could alienate Back to the Future's passionate fan base, and undermine the pair after their first major joint success. Zemeckis and Gale acquiesced by 1987, once Universal Pictures clarified they would, if necessary, make a sequel without them. The pair's sequel script was so long it was split into two films, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990); the films were shot back to back.
Part II depicts Marty and Doc traveling to 2015, inadvertently enabling the now-elderly Biff Tannen to steal the DeLorean and return to 1955, rewriting history in his favor. Wells and Glover did not return for the sequels. Part II was a financial success but was criticized for its complex, convoluted narrative. Zemeckis has said it is his least favorite film in the series. The final film, Part III follows Marty as he travels to 1885 to rescue a time-stranded Doc. While the film fared less well financially than the two earlier films, it was more critically well-received than Part II. A 2018 poll by The Hollywood Reporter of 2,200 people found 71% wanted a Back to the Future sequel, ahead of another Toy Story or Indiana Jones film. Gale has said there will never be a fourth film, likening it to ""selling your kids into prostitution"". He added a Back to the Future film could never happen without Fox, who could not participate because of the effects of his Parkinson's disease.
An animated television series, Back to the Future, aired on CBS between 1991 and 1992. It follows Doc's and Marty's adventures through various historical periods, intercut with live-action segments featuring Doc (Lloyd), performing science experiments alongside Bill Nye. A short film, Doc Brown Saves the World (2015), celebrated the film's 30th anniversary. Lloyd reprised his role as Doc, who must travel to the future to prevent a nuclear holocaust in 2045. A musical theater production, Back to the Future, debuted in February 2020 at the Manchester Opera House, England, to positive reviews. The musical was written by Gale and Zemeckis, with music written by Silvestri and Glen Ballard. Gale described it as the best way to give fans more Back to the Future without adding to the film series. In 2024, Zemeckis said he was interested in adapting the musical into a movie. Overall, the Back to the Future franchise is considered one of the most successful film franchises in history. "

Reservoir Dogs,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_Dogs,"The Reservoir Dogs: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was the first soundtrack for a Tarantino film and set the structure his later soundtracks would follow. This includes the extensive use of snippets of dialogue from the film. The soundtrack has selections of songs from the 1960s to '80s. Only the group Bedlam recorded original songs for the film. Reasoning that the film takes place over a weekend, Tarantino decided to set it to a fictional radio station 'K-Billy' (presumably KBLY)'s show ""K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies Weekend"", a themed weekend show of songs from the seventies. The radio station played a prominent role in the film. The DJ for the radio was chosen to be Steven Wright, a comedian known for his deadpan delivery of jokes.
An unusual feature of the soundtrack was the choice of songs; Tarantino has said that he feels the music to be a counterpoint to the on-screen violence and action. He also stated that he wished for the film to have a 1950s feel while using '70s music. A prominent instance of this is the torture scene to the tune of ""Stuck in the Middle with You"". "," The film was screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.
It won the Critic's Award at the 4th Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival in February 1993, which Tarantino attended. The film was also nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. Steve Buscemi won the 1992 Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male. Reservoir Dogs ranks at No. 97 in Empire magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time. In 2024, Reservoir Dogs was ranked second on the list of the Sundance Film Festival's Top 10 films of All Time based on a survey conducted with 500 filmmakers and critics in honor of the festival's 40th anniversary.

AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes & Villains:
Mr. Blonde – Nominated Villain ","Quentin Tarantino had been working at Video Archives, a video store in Manhattan Beach, California, and originally planned to shoot the film with his friends on a budget of $30,000 in a 16 mm black-and-white format, with himself playing Mr. Pink and producer Lawrence Bender playing both Nice Guy Eddie and a police officer chasing Mr. Pink. Bender gave the script to his acting teacher, whose wife gave the script to Harvey Keitel. Keitel liked it enough to sign as a co-producer so Tarantino and Bender would have an easier job finding funding; with his assistance, they raised $1.5 million. Keitel also paid for Tarantino and Bender to host casting sessions in New York, where the duo found Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth. Tim Roth's agents originally wanted him to be Mr. Pink or Mr. Blonde, but he preferred Mr. Orange because he would ""be an English actor pretending to be American playing a cop pretending to be a robber"". Michael Madsen wanted to play Mr Pink and auditioned for that part but Tarantino insisted that he play Mr Blonde. Jon Cryer was asked to audition for the role of Mr. Pink, but he backed out at the last minute. James Woods was also considered for Mr. Pink, but his agent turned it down without telling him. Viggo Mortensen, George Clooney, Samuel L. Jackson and  David Duchovny also read for roles.
The film contains multiple homages to other films.  In a 1992 interview, Tarantino says he likes the title of Reservoir Dogs because ""it sounds like in a film by Alain Delon by Jean-Pierre Melville... I could see Alain Delon in a black suit say: ""I'm Mr. Blonde"". Moreover, Le Samouraï  is one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite films and influenced him in the creation of the world of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.  The idea of the costumes of the films comes from a discussion between Tarantino and the costume designer Betsy Heimann, about French noir films with Alain Delon. Tarantino has said that Reservoir Dogs was influenced by Stanley Kubrick's 1956 film noir The Killing: ""I didn't go out of my way to do a rip-off of The Killing, but I did think of it as my 'Killing', my take on that kind of heist movie."" The film's plot was also inspired by the 1952 film Kansas City Confidential. Additionally, Joseph H. Lewis's 1955 film The Big Combo and Sergio Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django inspired the scene where a police officer is tortured in a chair. Having the main characters named after colors (Mr. Pink, White, Brown, etc.) was first seen in the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The film also contains key elements similar to those found in Ringo Lam's 1987 film City on Fire. Tarantino praised the film City on Fire and mentioned it as a major influence.
The film's production experienced several significant difficulties. Tarantino said that everybody ""hated"" Lawrence Tierney by the end of the first week of production because of his on-set behavior and volatility; he seemed (to some of the cast and crew) to be evincing psychological problems. Ultimately Tierney was fired, with Tarantino stating ""Tierney was a f—ing nightmare. He was completely insane. He was so crazy... All the other actors and the crew can’t stand him. And all of a sudden, he yells at me, does something disrespectful and so, I fired him at the breakfast table. The crew breaks into applause.""
The warehouse scenes were filmed in an unused mortuary filled with caskets, funeral equipment, embalming fluid, and a hearse. Mr. Orange's apartment was a room on the second floor of the mortuary, set to look like living quarters. The building has since been demolished.
Tarantino's decision not to film the diamond robbery was twofold: for budgetary reasons, and to keep the details of the heist ambiguous. By not showing the robbery and having the characters describe it, Tarantino explained, the film is allowed to be ""about other things"", similar to the way in which the burglary in Glengarry Glen Ross and its film adaptation is discussed, described, and debated, but never shown. Tarantino compared the technique to the work of a novelist, and said he wanted the film to be about something not seen and to ""play with a real-time clock as opposed to a movie clock ticking"". "
Jurassic Park,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film),"John Williams, a frequent composer of Spielberg's films, began scoring Jurassic Park at the end of February 1993. Alexander Courage and John Neufeld provided the score's orchestrations. Williams wrote themes designed to evoke a sense of wonder, attempting to imbue audiences with the feeling of ""admiration and respect"" that small children have when viewing dinosaur exhibits at a natural history museum. Three central themes were written, each with multiple variations. The first, associated with the herbivorous dinosaurs, was described by Williams as having ""almost a religious aspect"". The second, a more adventurous theme, is more unpredictable and adaptable, reflecting the park's capacity for wonder and terror. The third theme is built around a four-note motif, and is associated with the Velociraptors and the T. rex. However, two major sequences involving the T. rex do not use this theme. One is the escape sequence, which uses no music at all to increase tension, and the other is the T. rex's entrance in the climax, which was originally supposed to use the theme before Spielberg decided to use the adventure theme to reflect the T. rex being a heroic figure in the climax rather than a source of terror. Williams's recording session was on March 30, 1993, well into post-production, which meant that Spielberg was unable to sit in on the recording for the first time in all of their collaborations, as he was occupied filming Schindler's List in Poland. Instead, Williams previewed his scores on a piano for Spielberg to listen to before he left, and Spielberg was sent the full music in audio cassette form as it was finished. The first soundtrack album was released on May 25, 1993. For the 20th anniversary of the film's release, a new soundtrack was issued for digital download on April 9, 2013, including four bonus tracks selected by Williams. ", ,  
Schindler's List,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List,, ," Schindler's List opened in theaters on December 15, 1993, in the United States and December 25 in Canada. Its premiere in Germany was on March 1, 1994. Its American network television premiere was on NBC on February 23, 1997. Shown uncut and without commercials, it ranked No. 3 for the week with a 20.9/31 rating/share, the highest Nielsen rating for any film since NBC's broadcast of Jurassic Park in May 1995. The film aired on public television in Israel on Holocaust Memorial Day in 1998.
The film was released in a THX widescreen VHS format on September 9, 1997. The DVD was released on March 9, 2004, in widescreen and full screen editions, on a double-sided disc with the feature film beginning on side A and continuing on side B. Special features include a documentary introduced by Spielberg. Also released for both formats was a limited edition gift set, which included the widescreen version of the film, Keneally's novel, the film's soundtrack on CD, a senitype, and a photo booklet titled Schindler's List: Images of the Steven Spielberg Film, all housed in a plexiglass case. The laserdisc gift set was a limited edition that included the soundtrack, the original novel, and an exclusive photo booklet. As part of its 20th anniversary, the film was released on Blu-ray Disc on March 5, 2013. The film was digitally remastered in 4K, Dolby Vision and Atmos and was reissued into theaters on December 7, 2018, for its 25th anniversary. The film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 18, 2018.
Following the success of the film, Spielberg founded the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, a nonprofit organization with the goal of providing an archive for the filmed testimony of as many survivors of the Holocaust as possible, to save their stories. He continues to finance that work. Spielberg used proceeds from the film to finance several related documentaries, including Anne Frank Remembered (1995), The Lost Children of Berlin (1996), and The Last Days (1998). "
Forrest Gump,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump,"The soundtrack, featuring 32 songs from the film, was released on July 6, 1994.

Among the artists featured in the film are Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Hank Williams, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Aretha Franklin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Three Dog Night, The Byrds, The Beach Boys, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Doors, Canned Heat, Harry Nilsson, The Mamas & the Papas, The Doobie Brothers, Simon & Garfunkel, Bob Seger, Randy Newman, Willie Nelson, Fleetwood Mac, KC & The Sunshine Band, and Buffalo Springfield. Reflecting on compiling the soundtrack, music producer Joel Sill stated ""We wanted to have very recognizable material that would pinpoint time periods, yet we didn't want to interfere with what was happening cinematically."" The film and the two-disc album have a variety of music from the 1950s to the 1980s performed by American artists. According to Sill, Zemeckis requested this because he thought that American music was the only kind of music Forrest would buy, further stating ""All the material in there is American. Bob (Zemeckis) felt strongly about it. He felt that Forrest wouldn't buy anything but American.""
The soundtrack reached a peak of number 2 on the Billboard album chart. The soundtrack went on to sell twelve million copies, and is one of the top selling albums in the US. The Oscar-nominated score for the film was composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri and released on August 2, 1994. ", ,  
The Lion King,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King,"Lyricist Tim Rice, who was working with composer Alan Menken on songs for Aladdin (1992), was invited to write songs for The Lion King, and accepted on the condition of bringing in a composing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice's suggestion of Elton John, after Rice's invitation of ABBA fell through due to Benny Andersson's commitments to the stage musical Kristina från Duvemåla. John expressed an interest in writing ""ultra-pop songs that kids would like; then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them"", mentioning a possible influence of The Jungle Book (1967), where he felt the ""music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults"".
Rice and John wrote five original songs for The Lion King (""Circle of Life"", ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"", ""Be Prepared"", ""Hakuna Matata"", and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight""), with John's performance of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" playing over the end credits. The IMAX and DVD releases added another song, ""The Morning Report"", based on a song discarded during development that eventually featured in the live musical version of The Lion King. The score was composed by Hans Zimmer, who was hired based on his earlier work on two films in African settings, A World Apart (1988) and The Power of One (1992), and supplemented the score with traditional native African music and choir elements arranged by Lebo M. Zimmer said while uninterested at first due to a dislike of Broadway musicals, accepted the job to have a work he could watch with his daughter, and given he also lost his father as a child, used that as inspiration for the music regarding Mufasa's death. Zimmer's partners Mark Mancina and Jay Rifkin helped with arrangements and song production.
Jason Weaver recorded his song vocals as young Simba for ""I Just Can't Wait to be King,"" ""Hakuna Matata,"" and an unused song, 'Warthog Rhapsody,"" the day he came in for what was supposed to be an audition. His mother turned down Disney's initial financial offer and negotiated a fee of $100,000 plus royalties.
The Lion King original motion picture soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on April 27, 1994. It was the fourth-best-selling album of the year on the Billboard 200 and the top-selling soundtrack. It is the only soundtrack to an animated film to be certified Diamond (10× platinum) by the Recording Industry Association of America. Zimmer's complete instrumental score for the film was never originally given a full release, until the soundtrack's commemorative twentieth anniversary re-release in 2014. The Lion King also inspired the 1995 release Rhythm of the Pride Lands, with eight songs by Zimmer, Mancina, and Lebo M.
The use of the song ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa led to disputes between Disney and the family of South African Solomon Linda, who composed the song (originally titled ""Mbube"") in 1939. In July 2004, Linda's family filed a lawsuit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money. ", ,  
Pulp Fiction,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction,"No film score was composed for Pulp Fiction; Quentin Tarantino instead used an eclectic assortment of surf music, rock and roll, soul, and pop songs. Dick Dale's rendition of ""Misirlou"" plays during the opening credits. Tarantino chose surf music as the basic musical style for the film, but not, he insists, because of its association with surfing culture: ""To me it just sounds like rock and roll, even Morricone music. It sounds like rock and roll spaghetti Western music."" Tarantino planned to use a power pop song, ""My Sharona"" by The Knack, during the film's rape scene, but ultimately discounted it.
Some of the songs were suggested to Tarantino by his friends Chuck Kelley and Laura Lovelace, who were credited as music consultants. Lovelace also appeared in the film as Laura, a waitress; she reprises the role in Jackie Brown. The soundtrack album was released along with the film in 1994. The album peaked on the Billboard 200 chart at number 21. The single, Urge Overkill's cover of the Neil Diamond song ""Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon"", reached number 59.
Estella Tincknell describes how the particular combination of well-known and obscure recordings helps establish the film as a ""self-consciously 'cool' text. [The] use of the mono-tracked, beat-heavy style of early 1960s U.S. 'underground' pop mixed with 'classic' ballads such as Dusty Springfield's 'Son of a Preacher Man' is crucial to the film's postmodern knowingness."" She contrasts the soundtrack with that of Forrest Gump, the highest-grossing film of 1994, which also relies on period pop recordings: ""[T]he version of 'the sixties' offered by Pulp Fiction ... is certainly not that of the publicly recognized counter-culture featured in Forrest Gump, but is, rather, a more genuinely marginal form of sub-culture based around a lifestyle – surfing, 'hanging' – that is resolutely apolitical."" The soundtrack is central, she says, to the film's engagement with the ""younger, cinematically knowledgeable spectator"" it solicits. "," Pulp Fiction won eight major awards from a total of twenty-six nominations, including a Best Original Screenplay win at the 67th Academy Awards. Also, in the balloting by the National Society of Film Critics, Samuel L. Jackson was the runner-up in both the Best Actor and the Best Supporting Actor categories. In 2006, Writers Guild of America ranked its screenplay 16th in WGA’s list of 101 Greatest Screenplays.

Toy Story,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story,, ," Both Disney and Pixar held separate premieres for Toy Story, with Disney holding theirs at their flagship El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 19, 1995, and Pixar holding theirs the following night at the Regency Center in San Francisco. According to David Price's 2008 book The Pixar Touch, the film deeply resonated with audiences, with even the adults being noticeably moved by the film.
In some international territories, the theatrical release of the film was preceded by a re-release of the Roger Rabbit short Roller Coaster Rabbit.
In addition to showing at the El Capitan, where tickets included admission to the Totally Toy Story funhouse that Disney had built in the Hollywood Masonic Temple next door, the film opened on 2,281 screens on the 22nd and later expanded to 2,574.
The film was also shown at the Berlin International Film Festival out of competition from February 15 to 26, 1996. Elsewhere, the film opened in March 1996. "
Titanic,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1996_TV_miniseries),,,
The Fifth Element,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Element,," The Fifth Element was nominated for Best Sound Effects Editing at the 70th Academy Awards, and for Best Sound Editing at the 1998 Golden Reel Awards, but lost to Titanic in both cases. It won the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects, and the Lumière Award for Best Director. It was nominated for seven César awards, winning three: Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Production Design. It was nominated for Film of the Year at the 1997 European Film Awards, as well as the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, and the Satellite Award for Best Visual Effects. Thierry Arbogast was awarded the Technical Grand Prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for his work on both The Fifth Element and She's So Lovely. The film received four Saturn Award nominations: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Costume, Best Special Effects, and Best Supporting Actress for Milla Jovovich. Jovovich's fight against the Mangalores was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight, and the actress was also nominated for Best Actress – Newcomer at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards.
Conversely, Jovovich received a Golden Raspberry nomination for Worst Supporting Actress, and Chris Tucker was nominated for Worst New Star for his performances in both The Fifth Element and Money Talks. The film also received four nominations at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Supporting Actor for Tucker, and Worst Supporting Actress for Jovovich. ","  A novel was adapted from the screenplay of The Fifth Element, written by Terry Bisson and published by HarperPrism in 1997. Rumors arose after the film's release that it would be followed by a sequel, tentatively titled Mr. Shadow. In 2011, Besson said that he never planned a sequel and has no desire to make one.
Gaumont Multimedia commissioned developer Kalisto Entertainment to develop a video-game adaptation of The Fifth Element in 1998 for the PlayStation game console and PC. The PlayStation version generally received negative reviews, but the PC version was better received. Lauren Fielder from GameSpot described the PlayStation version as ""quite possibly the worst game I've ever played"". Doug Perry from IGN wrote: ""Take Tomb Raider, add in Leeloo Multipass and boring puzzles, and you've got Fifth Element.""
A racing game based on the film, New York Race, was released in 2001. Eurogamer gave the game 6 out of 10, concluding: ""New York Race is a fun little arcade racer, which oozes style, but it's something you'll grow tired of extremely quickly and as such remains fun only in short bursts."" "

The Truman Show,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show,"The Truman Show: Music from the Motion Picture was composed by Burkhard Dallwitz. Dallwitz was hired after Peter Weir received a tape of his work while in Australia for the post-production. Some parts of the soundtrack were composed by Philip Glass. Philip Glass also appears in the film playing his composition ""Truman Sleeps"".
Also featured are Frédéric Chopin's second movement (Romanze-Larghetto) from his First Piano Concerto, performed by the New Symphony Orchestra of London under the direction of Stanisław Skrowaczewski with pianist Artur Rubinstein; Wojciech Kilar's Father Kolbe's Preaching performed by the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra; as well as the song ""20th Century Boy"" performed by rockabilly band The Big Six.
Although not included on the soundtrack CD, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Rondo alla turca from his Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major, performed by Wilhelm Kempff, and his Horn Concerto No. 1, performed by the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra; plus ""Love Is Just Around the Corner"" by Jackie Davis were also featured in the film. ", ," Originally set for August 8, 1997, the film's theatrical release was pushed back initially to November 14, 1997, and then to the summer of 1998. NBC purchased broadcast rights in December 1997, roughly eight months before the film's release. In March 2000, Turner Broadcasting System purchased the rights, and now airs the film on TBS. "
Fight Club,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club,,"Cineaste's Gary Crowdus summarized the critical reception at the time, ""Many critics praised Fight Club, hailing it as one of the most exciting, original and thought-provoking films of the year."" He wrote of the negative opinion, ""While Fight Club had numerous critical champions, the film's critical attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be the excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs ... They felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless."" When Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, the film was fiercely debated by critics. A newspaper reported, ""Many loved and hated it in equal measures."" Some critics expressed concern that the film would incite copycat behavior, such as that seen after A Clockwork Orange debuted in Britain nearly three decades previously. Upon the film's theatrical release, The Times reported the reaction, ""It touched a nerve in the male psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world."" Although the film's makers called Fight Club ""an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s,"" some critics called it ""irresponsible and appalling."" Writing for The Australian, Christopher Goodwin stated, ""Fight Club is shaping up to be the most contentious mainstream Hollywood meditation on violence since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.""
Janet Maslin, reviewing for The New York Times, praised Fincher's direction and editing of the film. She wrote that Fight Club carried a message of ""contemporary manhood"" and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism. Roger Ebert, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave Fight Club two stars out of four, calling it ""visceral and hard-edged"", but also ""a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy,"" whose promising first act is followed by a second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as ""trickery."" Ebert later acknowledged that the film was ""beloved by most, not by me"". He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of Fight Club at the Conference on World Affairs; he stated that ""[s]eeing it over the course of a week, I admired its skill even more and its thought even less."" Jay Carr of The Boston Globe opined that the film began with an ""invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz"", but that it eventually became ""explosively silly.""
Newsweek's David Ansen described Fight Club as ""an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload"" and thought that the ending was too pretentious. Richard Schickel of Time described the mise en scène as dark and damp: ""It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry."" Schickel applauded the performances of Pitt and Norton, but criticized the ""conventionally gimmicky"" unfolding and the failure to make Bonham Carter's character interesting. In Alexander Walker's highly critical review for the London Evening Standard with the headline ""A Nazi piece of work"", he claimed that the story was ""a paradigm of the Hitler state"". Two quotes from his review (""It is an inadmissable assault on personal decency. And on society itself."" and ""It echoes propaganda that gave licence to the brutal activities of the SA and the SS. It resurrects the Fuhrer principle."") were among several negative critical opinions included in the booklet accompanying the 2000 DVD release.
The film review website Metacritic surveyed 36 critics and assessed 24 reviews as positive, 10 as mixed and 2 as negative. It gave an aggregate score of 67 out of 100, which it said indicated ""generally favorable"" reviews. The similar website Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 185 critics and, categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, assessed 149 as positive and 36 as negative. For the subset of reviews that had scores, it determined an average rating of 7.4 out of 10. It gave the film a score of 81% and summarized the critical consensus, ""Solid acting, amazing direction and elaborate production design make Fight Club a wild ride."" Fight Club was nominated for the 2000 Academy Award for Best Sound Editing, but it lost to The Matrix. Bonham Carter won the 2000 Empire Award for Best British Actress. The Online Film Critics Society also nominated Fight Club for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor (Norton), Best Editing and Best Adapted Screenplay (Uhls). Though the film won none of the awards, the organization listed Fight Club as one of the top ten films of 1999. The soundtrack was nominated for a BRIT Award, losing to Notting Hill. ",

The Matrix,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix,," The Matrix received Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. The filmmakers were competing against other films with established franchises, like Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, yet they won all four of their nominations. The Matrix also received BAFTA awards for Best Sound and Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects, in addition to nominations in the cinematography, production design and editing categories. In 1999, it won Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction. In February 2022, the film was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' ""Oscars Fan Favorite"" contest, for the ""bullet time"" scene, finishing in fifth place. ",  
Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace,"As with previous Star Wars films, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace's score was composed and conducted by John Williams. He started composing the score in October 1998 and began recording the music with the London Voices and London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios on February 10, 1999. Williams decided to use electronic instruments such as synthesizers to enhance the sound and choral pieces to ""capture the magical, mystical force that a regular orchestra might not have been able to provide"", and create an atmosphere that was ""more mysterious and mystical and less military"" than those of the original trilogy. One of the most notable tracks is ""Duel of the Fates"", which uses the chorus to give a religious, temple-like feel to the epic lightsaber duel. The track was made into a music video. While composing Anakin's theme, Williams tried to reflect the innocence of his childhood and to foreshadow his transformation into Darth Vader by using slight suggestions of ""The Imperial March"" in the melody.
The film's soundtrack was released by Sony Classical Records on May 4, 1999. The album made its broadcast premiere on C101.5 FM Mohawk College Radio's soundtrack program, Cinematic Sound, hosted by Erik Woods on May 1, 1999.  This album featured the score, which Williams restructured as a listening experience; it is not presented in film order and omits many notable cues from the film because of the space restriction of the compact disc. A two-disc ""Ultimate Edition"" was released on November 14, 2000. The set features the entire score as it is heard in the film, including all of the edits and loops that were made for the sound mix. ", ,  
Toy Story 2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story_2,"Randy Newman, who composed and conducted music for the original Toy Story film, returned to score the sequel. He wrote two original songs – ""When She Loved Me"", performed by Sarah McLachlan, and ""Woody's Roundup"", performed by Riders in the Sky – besides composing the score. The song from Toy Story, ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" was also reused. It was sung at two different points during the film by Tom Hanks as Woody and Robert Goulet, the singing voice of Wheezy. The score released by Walt Disney Records on November 9, 1999. The track ""When She Loved Me"", which was considered to be among the saddest sequences in both Disney and Pixar films, and the saddest film songs ever written, received acclaim for McLachlan's singing and Newman's compositions. The song was nominated at the Academy Awards in 2000 for Best Original Song, though the award went to Phil Collins for ""You'll Be in My Heart"" from another Disney animated film, Tarzan. ", ,

The score lost both these awards to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, but after sixteen nominations, the song ""If I Didn't Have You"" finally won Newman his first Academy Award for Best Original Song.

In January 2000, Warner Bros. was reported to be moving forward with Steven Soderbergh on development of an Ocean's Eleven remake, starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. Johnny Depp was being considered for Linus Caldwell, while Luke and Owen Wilson were in discussions to play the Malloy twins. The Wilson brothers had to decline due to their commitment to The Royal Tenenbaums. Mike Myers, Bruce Willis, Ewan McGregor, Alan Arkin and Ralph Fiennes were considered for roles but also ended up dropping out. Willis said in 2007 that he regretted turning down the role of Terry Benedict, and that he had done so because when he saw the script the character was not finished. Filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen were considered as replacements for the Wilson brothers, but Soderbergh cast Caan and Affleck instead. Mark Wahlberg was originally cast as Caldwell, but left in favor of starring in another remake, Planet of the Apes, and was subsequently replaced with Damon. Clooney's commitment to Ocean's Eleven forced him to turn down the lead role in Unfaithful.
Ocean's Eleven was filmed between February 11 and June 7, 2001, primarily in Las Vegas, but with some scenes shot in New Jersey, Chicago, Los Angeles, Florida, and Burbank. As producer Jerry Weintraub was friends with the Bellagio's owner, Kirk Kerkorian, the production team was granted permission to film there; also, the cast stayed at the hotel during the shoot. The ""pinch"" used in the film to black out power in Las Vegas was based on the real-life Sandia Z-pinch. However, the effect shown is unrealistic, as no device of the size shown could achieve that effect.
Cheadle was uncredited for his role. In an interview, Cheadle said, ""there was some stuff that happened behind the scenes that I didn’t like how it went down, so I just said, 'Take my name off it.'"" Takarazuka Revue adapted the movie as a musical in 2011–2012 in Japan (Takarazuka Grand Theater; Tokyo Takarazuka Theater). The production was performed by Star Troupe and the cast included Reon Yuzuki as Danny Ocean, Nene Yumesaki as Tess Ocean and Shio Suzumi as Rusty Ryan.

Spider-Man,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2002_film),,"In The Creation of Spider-Man, comic book writer-editor and historian Paul Kupperberg calls the character's superpowers ""nothing too original""; what was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a ""nerdy high school student"". Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man included ""heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of melodrama"". Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics: ""the flawed superhero with everyday problems"". This idea spawned a comics revolution. The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel's early 1960s comic books, such as The Amazing Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The Fantastic Four, and The X-Men ushered in a new type of superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the public's perception of them. Later stories also affected the entire genre of superhero comics. Historians of the genre have argued that the dark, pessimistic conclusion of the 1973 story ""The Night Gwen Stacy Died"" is partly responsible from the shift from the idealistic Silver Age of Comic Books to the more violent and troubled Bronze Age of Comic Books.
Spider-Man has become one of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world, and has been used to sell toys, games, cereal, candy, soap, and many other products. After the comics depicted a real address in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, as May Parker's residence, its residents received many letters from children to the superhero. He has been used as the company mascot. When Marvel became the first comic book company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991, The Wall Street Journal announced ""Spider-Man is coming to Wall Street""; the event was in turn promoted with an actor in a Spider-Man costume accompanying Stan Lee to the Stock Exchange.  Comics scholars Robert G. Weiner and Robert Moses Peaslee argue that Spider-Man is the clear flagship character of Marvel Comics and one of the best-known superheroes worldwide, only rivaled by Batman and Superman. They draw from research that indicates he is a globally recognizable character. They cite statistics that from 1966 to 2012 The Amazing Spider-Man sold an estimated 145-150 million copies. As of 2014, Spider-Man was the world's most profitable superhero. In 2014, global retail sales of licensed products related to Spider-Man reached approximately $1.3 billion. Comparatively, this amount exceeds the global licensing revenue of Batman, Superman, and the Avengers combined.

Spider-Man joined the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1987 to 1998 as one of the balloon floats, designed by John Romita Sr., one of the character's signature artists. A new, different Spider-Man balloon float also appeared from 2009 to 2014.
When Marvel wanted to issue a story dealing with the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the company chose the November 2001 issue of The Amazing Spider-Man. In 2006, Spider-Man garnered major media coverage with the revelation of the character's secret identity, an event detailed in a full-page story in the New York Post before the issue containing the story was even released.
In 2008, Marvel announced plans to release a series of educational comics the following year in partnership with the United Nations, depicting Spider-Man alongside the UN Peacekeeping Forces to highlight UN peacekeeping missions. A BusinessWeek article listed Spider-Man as one of the top 10 most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.
In 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, a case concerning royalties on a patent for an imitation web shooter. The opinion for the Court, by Justice Elena Kagan, included several Spider-Man references, concluding with the statement that ""with great power, there must also come—great responsibility"".
Spider-Man has become a subject of scientific inquiry. In 1987, researchers at Loyola University conducted a study into the utility of Spider-Man comics for informing children and parents about issues relating to child abuse.

In 2005, Bravo's Ultimate Super Heroes, Vixens, and Villains TV series declared that Spider-Man was the number 1 superhero. Empire magazine ranked him the fifth-greatest comic book character of all time. Wizard magazine placed Spider-Man as the third-greatest comic book character on their website. In 2011, Spider-Man placed third on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time, behind DC Comics characters Superman and Batman, and sixth in their 2012 list of ""The Top 50 Avengers"". In 2014, IGN identified Spider-Man the greatest Marvel Comics character of all time. A 2015 poll at Comic Book Resources named Spider-Man the greatest Marvel character of all time. IGN described him as the common everyman that represents many normal people, but also noted his uniqueness compared to many superheroes with his depicted flaws as a superhero. IGN wrote that despite being one of the most tragic superheroes of all time, he is ""one of the most fun and snarky superheroes in existence."" Empire praised Spider-Man's always-present sense of humor and wisecracks in the face of the many tragedies he faces. The magazine website appraised the depiction of his ""iconic"" superhero poses, describing it as ""a top artist's dream"".

Hans Zimmer served as the music producer. Seven other composers, including Geoff Zanelli and Ramin Djawadi, received credit for ""additional music"". Verbinski oversaw the score with Badelt and Zimmer, who headed 15 composers to finish it quickly.
Composer Alan Silvestri, who had collaborated with Verbinski on Mouse Hunt and The Mexican, was originally hired to write the film's score. Citing creative differences with Bruckheimer, Silvestri left the project before recording any material. Verbinski and Bruckheimer decided to go with Zimmer's team instead, who were frequent collaborators on their productions. Zimmer declined to do the bulk of the composing, as he was busy scoring The Last Samurai. As a result, he referred Verbinski to Klaus Badelt, a relatively new composer who had been a part of Remote Control Productions, known as Media Ventures at the time, for three years. At that point, Badelt had only composed a few films, including The Time Machine, The Recruit, K-19: The Widowmaker and Basic. As for Zimmer however, he ended up collaborating with Badelt to write most of the score's primary themes. Zimmer said he wrote most of the music in the space of one night, and then recorded them in an all-synthesized demo credited to him. This demo presents three of the score's themes and motifs, concluding with an early version of ""He's A Pirate"" which differs from the final cue and includes a development of a melody Zimmer wrote for the score to Drop Zone. 
The song Elizabeth Swann sings in the opening of the film as a child, and then later on the island marooned with Jack Sparrow, is called ""Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)'"". It was written by George Bruns with lyrics by Xavier ""X"" Atencio. It is the song heard throughout the attraction Pirates of the Caribbean in Disneyland and Magic Kingdom. ", ,

The Departed,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Departed, , ,"In January 2003, Warner Bros. Pictures, and producers Brad Grey and Brad Pitt bought the rights to remake the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs (2002) from Media Asia Entertainment Group for $1.75 million. William Monahan was secured as a screenwriter, and later Martin Scorsese, who admired Monahan's script, came on board as director.
In March 2004, United Press International announced that Scorsese would be remaking Infernal Affairs and setting it in Boston, and that Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt were slated to star. Pitt, tentatively scheduled to play Sullivan, later declined to play the role, saying a younger actor should play the part; he decided to produce the film instead. Scorsese's associate Kenneth Lonergan suggested Matt Damon, who grew up in Boston, for the part of Sullivan, and Scorsese asked Jack Nicholson to play Costello. Robert De Niro was approached to play Queenan, but De Niro declined in order to direct The Good Shepherd instead. Scorsese would later say that De Niro turned down the role as he was not interested. Ray Liotta was approached for a role in the film, but declined due to a commitment to another project.
Nicholson wanted the film to have ""something a little more"" than the usual gangster film, and screenwriter Monahan came up with the idea of basing the Costello character on Irish-American gangster Whitey Bulger. This gave the screenplay an element of realism—and an element of dangerous uncertainty, because of the wide-ranging carte blanche the FBI gave Bulger in exchange for revealing information about fellow gangsters. A technical consultant on the film was Tom Duffy, who had served three decades on the Boston Police Department, particularly as an undercover detective investigating the Irish mob.
The Departed was officially greenlit by Warner Bros. in early 2005 and shooting began on April 18 of that year. Some of the film was shot on location in Boston. For budgetary and logistical reasons many scenes, in particular interiors, were shot in locations and sets in New York City, which had tax incentives for filmmakers that Boston at the time did not.
Warner Bros. Pictures acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film excluding the U.K., Ireland, France, Belgium, Italy, the CIS, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. IEG sold the film to Entertainment Film Distributors in the U.K. and Ireland, TFM Distribution in France, Medusa Distribuzione in Italy, Belga Films in Belgium, Central Partnership in Russia and Ukraine, Media Asia Distribution in China and Hong Kong and Long Shong in Taiwan.

The Prestige,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige_(film),,,"Julian Jarrold's and Sam Mendes' producer approached Christopher Priest for an adaptation of his novel The Prestige. Priest was impressed with Christopher Nolan's films Following and Memento, and subsequently, producer Valerie Dean brought the book to Nolan's attention. In October 2000, Nolan traveled to the United Kingdom to publicize Memento, as Newmarket Films was having difficulty finding a United States distributor. While in London, Nolan read Priest's book and shared the story with his brother Jonathan while walking around in Highgate (a location later featured in the scene where Angier ransoms Borden's stage engineer in Highgate Cemetery). The development process for The Prestige began as a reversal of their earlier collaboration: Jonathan Nolan had pitched his initial story for Memento to his brother during a road trip.
A year later, the option on the book became available and was purchased by Aaron Ryder of Newmarket Films. In late 2001, Nolan became busy with the post-production of Insomnia, and asked his brother to help work on the script. The writing process was a long collaboration between the Nolan brothers, occurring intermittently over a period of five years. In the script, the Nolans emphasized the magic of the story through the dramatic narrative, playing down the visual depiction of stage magic. The three-act screenplay was deliberately structured around the three elements of the film's illusion: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. ""It took a long time to figure out how to achieve cinematic versions of the very literary devices that drive the intrigue of the story,"" Christopher Nolan told Variety: ""The shifting points of view, the idea of journals within journals and stories within stories. Finding the cinematic equivalents of those literary devices was very complex."" Although the film is thematically faithful to the novel, two major changes were made to the plot structure during the adaptation process: the novel's spiritualism subplot was removed, and the modern-day frame story was replaced with Borden's wait for the gallows. Priest approved of the adaptation, describing it as ""an extraordinary and brilliant script, a fascinating adaptation of my novel.""

In early 2003, Nolan planned to direct the film before the production of Batman Begins accelerated. Following the release of Batman Begins, Nolan started up the project again, negotiating with Jackman and Bale in October 2005. Josh Hartnett pitched Nolan for a role. While the screenplay was still being written, production designer Nathan Crowley began the set design process in Nolan's garage, employing a ""visual script"" consisting of scale models, images, drawings, and notes. Jonathan and Christopher Nolan finished the final shooting draft on January 13, 2006, and began production three days later on January 16. Filming ended on April 9.
Crowley and his crew searched Los Angeles for almost 70 locations that resembled fin de siècle London. Jonathan Nolan visited Colorado Springs to research Nikola Tesla and based the electric-bulb scene on actual experiments Tesla conducted. Nathan Crowley helped design the scene for Tesla's invention; It was shot in the parking lot of the Mount Wilson Observatory. Influenced by a ""Victorian modernist aesthetic,"" Crowley chose four locations in the Broadway theater district in downtown Los Angeles for the film's stage magic performances: the Los Angeles Theatre, the Palace Theatre, the Los Angeles Belasco, and the Tower Theatre. Crowley also turned a portion of the Universal back lot into Victorian London. Osgood Castle in Colorado was also used as a location.
Nolan built only one set for the film, an ""under-the-stage section that houses the machinery that makes the larger illusions work,"" preferring to simply dress various Los Angeles locations and sound stages to stand in for Colorado and Victorian England. In contrast to most period pieces, Nolan kept up the quick pace of production by shooting with handheld cameras, and refrained from using artificial lighting in some scenes, relying instead on natural light on location. Costume designer Joan Bergin chose attractive, modern Victorian fashions for Scarlett Johansson; cinematographer Wally Pfister captured the mood with soft earth tones as white and black colors provided background contrasts, bringing actors' faces to the foreground.  Editing, scoring, and mixing finished on September 22, 2006. Touchstone Pictures opted to move the release date forward by a week, from the original October 27, to October 20, 2006. The film earned $14.8 million on opening weekend in the United States, debuting at #1. It grossed $109 million worldwide, including $53 million from the United States. The film received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Nathan Crowley and Julie Ochipinti) and the Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Wally Pfister), as well as a nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form in 2007. The film was also nominated for both Best Science Fiction Film and Best Costume Design the Saturn Awards. "

Iron Man,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(2008_film),,"Iron Man's appearances in the 1960s saw mixed reception from readers, many of whom criticized the character for his association with the United States military and the controversial Vietnam War. In response, Marvel rewrote the character in the 1970s to moderate his image and to have him directly reflect on his culpability in the harms caused by war. According to Lee, Iron Man was the most popular hero when reading fanmail from female readers, which he attributed to both the character's charisma and his tragic nature.
Many stories featuring the character have achieved critical acclaim. ""Demon in a Bottle"" in Iron Man #120–129 (1979) is celebrated as the definitive Iron Man story for exploring the depth of his character through his alcoholism. ""Doomquest"" in #149–150 (1981) is a popular favorite for its lighter tone and its establishment of a rivalry between Iron Man and Doctor Doom. ""Armor Wars"" in #225–232 (1987–1988) is credited for developing Iron Man's personality as someone willing to be more aggressive at the expense of his alliances and public trust. ""Extremis"" in Iron Man Vol. 4 #1–6 (2005–2006) is recognized as a landmark for a new modern era of Iron Man comics. Other celebrated stories include ""Deliverance"" in Iron Man #182 (1984), the ""Iron Monger Saga"" in Iron Man #190–200 (1984–1985), and ""World's Most Wanted"" in Invincible Iron Man #8–19 (2009). Iron Man's characterization in Civil War (2006–2007) was received negatively, with most readers seeing him as the villain.
Iron Man became widely popular following the success of the 2008 film Iron Man, which made him one of Marvel's most recognizable characters, and the film is credited with redefining the superhero film genre. Since then, many publishers have listed Iron Man among the top ten in lists of best superheroes and best Marvel characters. Iron Man's portrayal of futuristic technology has affected public image of how these technologies may develop. Heavy use of augmented reality interfaces by Iron Man, in his helmet's heads-up display and elsewhere, has informed public awareness of the technology. In 2019, a statue representing the character in his Iron Man armor was erected in Forte dei Marmi, Italy, to memorialize the character's actions in Avengers: Endgame (2019) and as a reminder that ""the future of humanity depends on our decisions ... that all of us must be heroes!"".

WALL-E,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E,, ," WALL-E premiered at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on June 23, 2008. Continuing a Pixar tradition, the film was paired with a short film for its theatrical release, Presto. The film is dedicated to Justin Wright (1981–2008), a Pixar animator who had worked on Ratatouille and died of a heart attack before WALL-E's release. However, WALL-E is the first Pixar film to stop using the 1995 Pixar exclusive Walt Disney Pictures logo customized for the studio since Toy Story (1995).
Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) built animatronic WALL-Es to promote the picture, which made appearances at Disneyland Resort, the Franklin Institute, the Miami Science Museum, the Seattle Center, and the Tokyo International Film Festival. Due to safety concerns, the 318 kg robots were always strictly controlled and WDI always needed to know exactly what they were required to interact with. For this reason, they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL-E trod on a child's foot. Those who wanted to take a photograph with the character had to make do with a cardboard cutout.
The film was denied a theatrical release in China.
In 2016, Jim Morris noted that the studio has no plans for a sequel, as they consider WALL-E a finished story with no need for continuation.
To promote the film, a website was created for Buy n Large, the featuring megacorporation. This website had fake press releases beginning in 2057, including ""Wisconsin Mall Granted City Status,"" ""BnL Announces Police Select.""

The film's first full teaser trailer premiered on Entertainment Tonight on February 10, 2009, and was shown in US theaters the following week attached to Friday the 13th. The trailer features excerpts of Lt. Aldo Raine talking to the Basterds, informing them of the plan to ambush and kill, torture, and scalp unwitting German servicemen, intercut with various other scenes from the film. It also features the spaghetti-westernesque terms Once Upon A Time In Nazi Occupied France, which was considered for the film's title, and A Basterd's Work Is Never Done, a line not spoken in the final film (the line occurs in the script during the Bear Jew's backstory).
The film was released on August 19, 2009, in the United Kingdom and France, two days earlier than the US release date of August 21, 2009. It was released in Germany on August 20, 2009. Some European cinemas, however, showed previews starting on August 15. In Poland, the artwork on all advertisements and on DVD packaging is unchanged, but the title was translated non-literally to Bękarty Wojny (Bastards of War), so that Nazi iconography could stylize the letter ""O"". Tarantino did not misspell the title to differentiate his film from the 1978 movie by the same name. He said it instead was a creative decision which he initially refused to explain, simply saying that ""Basterds"" was spelled as such because ""that's just the way you say it"". "
Sherlock Holmes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_(2009_film),, ,"The popularity of Sherlock Holmes has meant that many writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle have created tales of the detective in a wide variety of different media, with varying degrees of fidelity to the original characters, stories, and setting. The first known pastiche dates from 1891. Titled ""My Evening with Sherlock Holmes"", it was written by Conan Doyle's close friend J. M. Barrie.
Adaptations have seen the character taken in radically different directions or placed in different times or even universes. For example, Holmes falls in love and marries in Laurie R. King's Mary Russell series, is re-animated after his death to fight future crime in the animated series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century, and is meshed with the setting of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos in Neil Gaiman's ""A Study in Emerald"" (which won the 2004 Hugo Award for Best Short Story). An especially influential pastiche was Nicholas Meyer's The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, a 1974 New York Times bestselling novel (made into the 1976 film of the same name) in which Holmes's cocaine addiction has progressed to the point of endangering his career. It served to popularize the trend of incorporating clearly identified and contemporaneous historical figures (such as Oscar Wilde, Aleister Crowley, Sigmund Freud, or Jack the Ripper) into Holmesian pastiches, something Conan Doyle himself never did. Another common pastiche approach is to create a new story fully detailing an otherwise-passing canonical reference (such as an aside by Conan Doyle mentioning the ""giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared"" in ""The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire"").
The first translation of a Sherlock Holmes story into a Chinese variety was done by Chinese Progress in 1896. That publication rendered the name as 呵爾唔斯, which would be 呵尔唔斯 in Simplified Chinese and Hē'ěrwúsī in Modern Standard Mandarin. Shanghai Civilization Books later issued versions rendering Holmes's name differently, as 福爾摩斯 in Traditional Chinese, which would be 福尔摩斯 in Simplified Chinese and Fú'ěrmósī in Modern Standard Mandarin; this version became the common way of rendering ""Holmes"" in Chinese languages.

Gregson-Williams earlier met Hood during the 63rd Golden Globe Awards dinner party where they were nominated for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Tsotsi (both 2005), and the collaborative discussions led him to the initial interest for the film's score. The score was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage in 20th Century Fox Studios, with Gregson-Williams conducting a 78-piece orchestra and a 40-member vocal choir. Varèse Sarabande released the soundtrack on April 28, 2009. ","On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 37% based on 258 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Though Hugh Jackman gives his all, he can't help X-Men Origins: Wolverine overcome a cliche-ridden script and familiar narrative."" On Metacritic the film has a score of 40 out of 100, based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale.
Richard Corliss of TIME commented on the film's standing among other Marvel films, saying that it is ""an O.K., not great, Marvel movie that tells the early story of the prime X-Man, and attempts to make it climax in a perfect coupling with the start of the known trilogy."" He also said that ""superhero mythologies can be so complicated, only a lonely comic-book-reading kid could make sense of it all."" James Mullinger of GQ also commented on the structure of the story in saying that the ""film clumsily tries to explain the origins of James [Howlett], AKA Wolverine, which had wisely only ever been briefly referred to in the original X-Men saga. In doing so, it creates a fairly bland plot which is full of holes."" Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor also praised Jackman's performance, saying that ""Hugh Jackman demonstrates that you can segue effortlessly from a tuxedoed song-and-dance man at the Oscars to a feral gent with adamantium claws and berserker rage."" Claudia Puig of USA Today considered the movie ""well-acted, with spectacular action and witty one-liners"".
Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and asked about the title character, ""Why should I care about this guy? He feels no pain and nothing can kill him, so therefore he's essentially a story device for action sequences."" James Berardinelli gave Wolverine two and a half stars out of four, calling the action scenes competently executed but not memorable, and considering that when dealing with Wolverine's past ""there's little creativity evident in the way those blanks are filled in"", and that the revelations made Wolverine ""less compelling"". Comparatively, Bill Gibron of AMC's Filmcritic.com website gave the film a positive ""4.0 out of 5 stars,"" saying that although Hugh Jackman is ""capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort, he singlehandedly makes X-Men Origins: Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season."" He predicted ""there will be purists who balk at how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology;"" and further said that ""any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can't really seal the full entertainment deal.""
Regarding Wolverine within the context of the X-Men film series, Tom Charity of CNN commented: ""Serviceable but inescapably redundant, this Wolverine movie does just enough to keep the X-Men franchise on life support, but the filmmakers will have to come up with some evolutionary changes soon if it's going to escape X-tinction."" Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed that ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes, but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue."" On a more negative note, Philip French of The Observer said that the film's ""dull, bone-crushing, special-effects stuff"" is ""of interest only to hardcore fans who've probably read it all in Marvel comics.""
Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph stated that ""Wolverine is an artificial stimulus package of the most unsatisfying kind. Aggressively advertised and hyped to the hills, it will no doubt attract full houses at first; after that though, when word-of-mouth buzz-kill goes into overdrive, there's bound to be widespread deflation and a palpable feeling of being conned."" Similarly, Orlando Parfitt of IGN (UK) praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes, but stated that the film felt underdeveloped: ""There's an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine, but it's also somewhat unsatisfying."" Furthermore, Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of ""D"", noting that ""Wolverine was the lead character of [the X-Men] films, and we've already learned everything we need to know from the films in said franchise,"" adding that ""the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan/Wolverine less interesting."" Steven Rea also felt that the film injured the character by proving that ""how the hero acquired his special powers turns out to be a whole lot less interesting than what he does with them"", while also being ""a mash-up of meaningless combat sequences (meaningless because Logan/Wolverine is just about unstoppable), sub-par visual effects, template backstory, and some goofy Liev Schreiber-as-a-villain thespianizing"".
Hugh Jackman later confessed being unhappy with the final result of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The actor wanted primarily a film that would deepen the Wolverine character, but ""somehow the first Wolverine movie ended up looking like the fourth X-Men — just with different characters."" He tried to avert the same results while doing the character's next solo film: 2013's The Wolverine. ",  
Alice in Wonderland,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_(2010_film),,"Alice was published to critical praise. One magazine declared it ""exquisitely wild, fantastic, [and] impossible"". In the late 19th century, Walter Besant wrote that Alice in Wonderland ""was a book of that extremely rare kind which will belong to all the generations to come until the language becomes obsolete"".

No story in English literature has intrigued me more than Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. It fascinated me the first time I read it as a schoolboy.
F. J. Harvey Darton argued in a 1932 book that Alice ended an era of didacticism in children's literature, inaugurating a new era in which writing for children aimed to ""delight or entertain"". In 2014, Robert McCrum named Alice ""one of the best loved in the English canon"" and called it ""perhaps the greatest, possibly most influential, and certainly the most world-famous Victorian English fiction"". A 2020 review in Time states: ""The book changed young people's literature. It helped to replace stiff Victorian didacticism with a looser, sillier, nonsense style that reverberated through the works of language-loving 20th-century authors as different as James Joyce, Douglas Adams and Dr. Seuss."" Joe Sommerlad in The Independent writes that Roald Dahl ""owes a debt to the ""Drink Me"" episode in Alice"" in regard to Dahl's George's Marvellous Medicine where the grandmother drinks a potion and is blown up to the size of a farmhouse. The protagonist of the story, Alice, has been recognised as a cultural icon. In 2006, Alice in Wonderland was named among the icons of England in a public vote. ","Books for children in the Alice mould emerged as early as 1869 and continued to appear throughout the late 19th century. Released in 1903, the British silent film Alice in Wonderland was the first screen adaptation of the book.
In 2015, Robert Douglas-Fairhurst wrote in the Guardian,

Since the first publication of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland 150 years ago, Lewis Carroll's work has spawned a whole industry, from films and theme park rides to products such as a ""cute and sassy"" Alice costume (""petticoat and stockings not included""). The blank-faced little girl made famous by John Tenniel's original illustrations has become a cultural inkblot we can interpret in any way we like.
Labelled ""a dauntless, no-nonsense heroine"" by the Guardian, the character of the plucky, yet proper, Alice has proven immensely popular and inspired similar heroines in literature and pop culture, many also named Alice in homage. The book has inspired numerous film and television adaptations, which have multiplied, as the original work is now in the public domain in all jurisdictions. Musical works inspired by Alice include the Beatles's song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", with songwriter John Lennon attributing the song's fantastical imagery to his reading of Carroll's books. Argentine prog-rock band Seru Giran used Alice as a metaphor to represent the political climate in Argentina during the 1970s in their song ""Canción de Alicia en el país"". A popular figure in Japan since the country opened up to the West in the late 19th century, Alice has been a popular subject for writers of manga and a source of inspiration for Japanese fashion, in particular Lolita fashion.

Director David Yates, who shot the film alongside director of photography Eduardo Serra, described Part 1 as ""quite real""; a ""road movie"" that's ""almost like a vérité documentary"".
Originally set for a single theatrical release, the idea to split the book into two parts was suggested by executive producer Lionel Wigram due to what David Heyman called ""creative imperative"". Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, ""No, David. How are we going to do it?"". After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division.
The production filmed at the Dartford Crossing for the dramatic chase where Harry and Hagrid are being ambushed by Death Eaters.  "

Inception,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception,"The score for Inception was composed and arranged by Hans Zimmer, who described his work as ""a very electronic, dense score"", filled with ""nostalgia and sadness"" to match Cobb's feelings throughout the film. The music was written simultaneously to filming, and features a guitar sound reminiscent of Ennio Morricone, played by Johnny Marr, former guitarist of the Smiths.
Édith Piaf's ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" (""No, I Regret Nothing"") appears throughout the film, used to accurately time the dreams, and Zimmer reworked pieces of the song into cues of the score.
A soundtrack album was released on July 11, 2010, by Reprise Records. The majority of the score was also included in high resolution 5.1 surround sound on the second disc of the two-disc Blu-ray release. Hans Zimmer's music was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Original Score category in 2011, losing to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of The Social Network.

It was unclear if Rachel McAdams would appear in the film; McAdams said, ""If I do, it won't be a very big thing. It's not a lead part."" Warner Bros. later confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that McAdams would play a part in the sequel but that it would be a cameo appearance. The female lead role was played by Noomi Rapace. Joel Silver, the film's producer, has said that ""we always intended to have a different kind of girl for each movie"" in the vein of Bond girls. He found it ""complicated"" to persuade McAdams to return in a smaller role: ""She loved being with us, but she hoped to have a bigger role. I think at the end of the day it worked out fine."" The death of Adler in the film left many fans speculating her character faked her demise.
The film, then under the working title of Sherlock Holmes 2, was reported to be influenced by Conan Doyle's ""The Final Problem"". While the film took place a year after the events of the first film, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was intended to be a stand-alone film that did not require knowledge of the previous movie.
In October 2010, the steamship PS Waverley was chartered on the English Channel for filming, and a large green screen was erected at Didcot Railway Centre, where a large action scene was filmed the following month. In late November, a scene was filmed at Victoria Bridge in Worcestershire, England. In January 2011, scenes were also filmed at Hampton Court Palace and areas in Oxford University.
In early February 2011, principal photography moved for two days to Strasbourg, France. Shooting took place on, around, and inside Strasbourg Cathedral. The scene was said at the time to be the opening scene of the film, as it covered an assassination and bombing in a German-speaking town.
The production also filmed at several locations in Kent including Fort Amherst, Knole and The Historic Dockyard Chatham. The White Cliffs of Dover are also briefly featured in the movie, as is the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich. Several scenes were also filmed at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire.

Praise has focused on the addictive quality, especially of the first book, and the action. Young adult fiction author John Green, writing for The New York Times, compared The Hunger Games with Scott Westerfeld's The Uglies series. Catching Fire was praised for improving upon the first book, and Mockingjay was praised for its portrayal of violence, well-realized worldbuilding, and romantic intrigue.
The series received criticism regarding its reality TV ""death game"" theme being derivative of earlier works, particularly Battle Royale, as well as The Running Man, The Long Walk, The 10th Victim, and Series 7: The Contenders. The series was also criticized for the romantic plotline: Rollie Welch of Ohio's The Plain Dealer criticized the characters' lack of resolute behavior, and Jennifer Reese of Entertainment Weekly stated that there was little distinction between Peeta and Gale and the series lacked the ""erotic energy"" seen in the Twilight series.
J.C. Maçek III of PopMatters stated, ""While the film saga does capture the action of The Hunger Games, the novels are most assuredly the heart of the story. They are nothing less than 'The Writer’s Cut' of the films themselves."" In his review Mike Ruiz argues that The Hunger Games film does not have the first-person narrative that is in the original novel. As a result, Ruiz contends the novel is better than the film.
The last book, Mockingjay, was criticized by Dan Shade of SF Site, who felt that Katniss is a weaker character than her comrades and less resolute in her journey to the Capitol, and that with respect to her vendetta against President Snow, her actions in the finale are inconsistent with her established character.

Men in Black 3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_Black_3,"The soundtrack for the film was composed by Danny Elfman and was released on May 29, 2012, four days after the film.
The song ""Back in Time"" by rapper Pitbull, which was not included on the film's soundtrack album but accompanies the end credits of the film, was released as a single on March 26, 2012. It is the first lead single released to accompany a Men in Black film not to be performed by Will Smith.
There were also many songs from the 1960s that feature, including ""2000 Light Years from Home"" by the Rolling Stones, ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" by the Velvet Underground, “I’m an old cowhand (from the rio grande)” by Roy Rogers and the sons of the pioneers,  ""Strange Brew"" by Cream, and ""Pictures of Matchstick Men"" by Status Quo. ", ,"The film's premise was first proposed to director Barry Sonnenfeld by Will Smith during the filming of Men in Black II in 2002, with Smith suggesting that his character, Agent J, travel back in time to save his partner, Agent K, while at the same time exploring Agent K's backstory. Sonnenfeld said the idea ""turned out to be a very long process of development, mainly because of the knotting  [sic] issues of time travel."" It was reported that Smith and executives were leery about bringing back Sonnenfeld because of conflicts on the set of Men in Black II. In a lawsuit filed against his former agents over commissions, Sonnenfeld alleged that Sony considered other directors for Men in Black 3. Sonnenfeld ultimately convinced all involved that he had a strong vision for the film.
The film was first announced on April 1, 2009, by Sony Pictures Entertainment president Rory Bruer during a Sony ShoWest presentation. By October 2009, Etan Cohen had been hired to write the screenplay. Sonnenfeld read the script and started working on it in January 2010. As of March 2010, Will Smith remained undecided whether to join the film or another, The City That Sailed. Sonnenfeld in May 2010 confirmed the return of Tommy Lee Jones and Smith. Both had expressed interest in 2008 in reprising their roles. The filmmakers also included Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald as producers, with Steven Spielberg as executive producer; all were producers of the two previous films. Sonnenfeld considered Mark Wahlberg for the role of younger Agent K, before casting Josh Brolin.
In June 2010, writer David Koepp was hired to rewrite the Cohen script. A third writer, Jeff Nathanson, was hired in November 2010 to rewrite the segment of the script that takes place in 1969. Nathanson and Koepp, along with producer Spielberg, had previously worked together on the 2008 film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which Spielberg directed.
Special effects artist Rick Baker created the practical aliens and prosthetic makeup for the film, reprising his role from the previous two Men in Black films. In designing the look for the alien creatures, Baker used the time travel plot device as a reason to design ""retro"" looking aliens reminiscent of science fiction B movies of the era, saying, ""In 2012 the aliens should look like Men in Black aliens and in 1969 they should be retro aliens. Fishbowl space helmets, guys with space suits with ribbed things on it, exposed brains, [and] bug eyes.""
Principal photography began on November 16, 2010, even though, ""We knew starting the movie that we didn't have a finished second or third act,"" director Sonnenfeld said in 2012. ""Was it responsible? The answer is, if this movie does as well as I think it will, it was genius. If it's a total failure, then it was a really stupid idea."" Filming was originally slated to commence on October 18, 2010, and continue until May 2011, in New York City, with shooting starting in 2010 partly in order to take advantage of a New York tax break in which the state rebates 30 percent of production costs incurred there. Filming was ultimately split into two parts, the first taking place from November until about Christmas 2010; the filmmakers announced shooting would begin again in mid-February, but it was delayed until April. Sonnenfeld initially stated he would be shooting in 3D, but later decided to film in 2D and convert to 3D during post-production.
Set photos for the film appeared online on November 17, 2010, showing Smith, Jones, Emma Thompson, and Nicole Scherzinger. Filming was done in April 2011 in the Morris Park section of The Bronx. Parts of Coney Island, in Brooklyn, had parking and filming permits posted for April 24 and May 2–4, 2011, production dates for what the permits titled MIB3. Shooting also took place in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, and was scheduled to wrap in June.
For the film, the Ford Taurus SHO was selected as the MIB's official car, replacing the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and Mercedes-Benz E-Class from the first two films. For the 1969 scenes, a 1964 Ford Galaxie was used as the MIB's official car.  "

As one of the largest airships in the world, it measured 165 feet (50 m) in length, 55 feet (17 m) in height, and weighed 8,000 pounds (3.6 t). Universal Pictures partnered the film with licensing and promotional partners valued at an unprecedented $200–$250 million in the next three years. One of the partners was McDonald's, which included in its Happy Meals various Minion toys, some of them unique to a specific country. To take advantage of banana-loving Minions, Chiquita ran various sweepstakes, and a Minion, voiced by Pierre Coffin, performed the song ""Chiquita Banana"" in the film. Thinkway Toys released various toys and figures, and Hasbro made special games. The campaign featured 600 toy brands. As a promotional tie-in, Despicable Me: Minion Rush was released.
Despicable Me 2 debuted on June 5, 2013, at Event Cinemas in Bondi Junction, Sydney, Australia, followed by a premiere on June 12, at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival. In the United States, the film's premiere took place on June 22, at the Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles, and was released in theaters on July 3. It was digitally re-mastered into IMAX 3D format and released in select international IMAX theaters.
As with the first film, which did not have a theatrical release in China, the film's distributor Universal Pictures had troubles releasing the sequel. When it was reported in July 2013 that the film had been denied a theatrical release in China, then the second-largest film market in the world, some analysts attributed this to the protection of locally produced animation. There were also rumors that the film's release was banned in China because the film's minions too much resembled former Chinese president Jiang Zemin. China's Film Bureau was ""furious"" about the negative comments, stating that the film was not submitted for censorship approval. In fact, there was reportedly a ""commercial conflict"" between Universal and Edko Films, the film's local distributor, over which titles are to be imported. Edko had decided that the film ""would not do well in China and decided against using one of the precious quota slots for the film.""

To employ the ""deeply thematic component with a strong melody,"" the score employs mostly orchestra sounds. The main theme for Iron Man focuses on horns and trumpets, to be ""both a march and anthem."" Tyler mentioned that John Williams' work on Raiders of the Lost Ark was the first thing he thought of as an influence, and the cue for the Well of Souls in Raiders influenced the Extremis motif, as Tyler felt it should enhance a spiritual side for having a ""technology so advanced that nears magic."" Echoing the Mandarin's amalgamated personality, his theme was religious music ""that borrows from many cultures,"" from ""Monastic, Gothic, and Christian chants to music from the Middle-East.""

Steven H Silver identified Brooks's international focus as the novel's greatest strength and commented favorably on Brooks's ability to create an appreciation for the work needed to combat a global zombie outbreak. Silver's only complaint was with ""Good-Byes"", the final chapter, in which characters get a chance to give a final closing statement; Silver felt that it was not always apparent who the sundry, undifferentiated characters were.
The Eagle described the book as being ""unlike any other zombie tale"" as it is ""sufficiently terrifying for most readers, and not always in a blood-and-guts way, either."" Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club stated that the format of the novel makes it difficult for it to develop momentum, but found the novel's individual episodes gripping. Patrick Daily of the Chicago Reader said the novel transcends the ""silliness"" of The Zombie Survival Guide by ""touching on deeper, more somber aspects of the human condition."" In his review for Time Out Chicago, Pete Coco declared that ""[b]ending horror to the form of alternative history would have been novel in and of itself. Doing so in the mode of Studs Terkel might constitute brilliance.""

Production was to begin at the start of 2009, but was delayed while the script was completely re-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan to set the film in the present – leaving behind much of the book's premise – to make it more of an action film. In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title. Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013. "

The Manila Bulletin says that the book is ""a collection of maudlin scenes and trite observations about the fragility of life and the wisdom of dying. And while it does talk about those things and more, the treatment of it is far from being maudlin or trite."" The Manila Bulletin also added that ""Just two paragraphs into the work, and he immediately wallops the readers with such an insightful observation delivered in such an unsentimental way that its hard not to shake your head in admiration.""

One notable unfavorable opinion appeared in the Daily Mail: the entire genre, as well as the genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm, was criticized as being ""distasteful"" and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's ""teen book club choice"" because ""it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness"". In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely ""in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them"". For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: ""The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and I feel like that article made those arguments."" ",

Captain America: Civil War,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_Civil_War,"Henry Jackman returned from The Winter Soldier to score the sequel.

Though Jackman reprised and developed his themes for Captain America and the Winter Soldier from the previous film, and introduced motifs for the new characters Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo, he was wary of pushing the audience to one side of the central conflict or the other by using character-specific music; Jackman composed a new main theme for the film to represent the Civil War, ""a generic theme to balance everything out"", ""toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped them all up and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes.""

Finding Dory,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Dory,"The film's soundtrack was composed and conducted by Thomas Newman and released on June 17, 2016. ", ,"Prior to work on Finding Dory, the idea of a sequel to Finding Nemo had been teased since Fall 2003.  Ellen DeGeneres said in September 2003 that she is game to dive back in for a sequel. ""Disney and Pixar have to make that deal right now, but everybody is all for it."" She joked that since Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz would pocket upwards of $5 million apiece for Shrek 2, ""Then I'll make $12 million."" Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich stated in an October 2003 interview to the British press that they were also not ruling out the possibility of making a sequel. ""After Toy Story came out everybody said 'Is there going to be another one? We all said 'No way!' But you never know--maybe we will do Finding Nemo 2!"".
In 2005, Disney had planned to make a Finding Nemo sequel without Pixar's involvement, through Circle Seven Animation, a studio Disney announced in 2005 with the intention to make sequels to Pixar properties. However, due to the 2006 acquisition of Pixar by Disney, Circle Seven was shut down by Disney without having produced a film. Although it never went into production, a script for the Circle Seven version was uploaded to the official Raindance Film Festival website. Elements of the unmade script included the introduction of Nemo's long-lost twin brother, Remy, and a storyline wherein Marlin is caught and must be saved.

In July 2012, Andrew Stanton was announced as the director of a Finding Nemo sequel, with Victoria Strouse writing the script. That same month, Stanton examined the veracity of the news involving the potential sequel. That August, Ellen DeGeneres had entered negotiations to reprise her role of Dory, and in September, the film was confirmed by Stanton, saying: ""What was immediately on the list was writing a second Carter movie. When that went away, everything slid up. I know I'll be accused by more sarcastic people that it's a reaction to Carter not doing well, but only in its timing, but not in its conceit."" In February 2013, it was confirmed by the press that Albert Brooks would reprise the role of Marlin in the sequel.
In April 2013, Disney announced the sequel, Finding Dory, confirming that DeGeneres and Brooks would be reprising their roles as Dory and Marlin, respectively. Following a long campaign for a sequel on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, DeGeneres stated:

""I have waited for this day for a long, long, long, long, long, long time. I'm not mad it took this long. I know the people at Pixar were busy creating Toy Story 16. But the time they took was worth it. The script is fantastic. And it has everything I loved about the first one: It's got a lot of heart, it's really funny, and the best part is—it's got a lot more Dory.""
In a July 2013 interview with Los Angeles Times, Stanton spoke of the sequel's origin: ""There was polite inquiry from Disney [about a Finding Nemo sequel]. I was always 'No sequels, no sequels.' But I had to get on board from a VP standpoint. [Sequels] are part of the necessity of our staying afloat, but we don't want to have to go there for those reasons. We want to go there creatively, so we said [to Disney], 'Can you give us the timeline about when we release them? Because we'd like to release something we actually want to make, and we might not come up with it the year you want it.'""
In a 2016 interview, Stanton stated how the film's story came to be; ""I don't watch my films that often after they're done because I have to watch them so many times before they come out. So about 2010 when we were getting Finding Nemo ready for the 10-year re-release in 3D, it was interesting to watch again after all that time. Something kind of got lodged in the back of my brain and started to sort of stew. I started to think about how easily Dory could get lost and not find Marlin and Nemo again. She basically was in the same state that she was when Marlin found her. I didn't know where she was from. I knew that she had spent most of her youth wandering the ocean alone, and I wanted to know that she could find her new family, if she ever got lost again. It's almost like the parental side of me was worried."" Stanton additionally stated: ""I knew if I ever said Finding Dory or mentioned a sequel to Finding Nemo out loud, I'd be done, [T]here would be no way I'd be able to put that horse back in the barn. So I kept it very quiet until I knew I had a story that I thought would hold, and that was in early 2012. So I pitched it to John Lasseter and he was all into it. Then I got a writer, and once we had a treatment that we kind of liked, I felt comfortable calling Ellen.""

Stanton selected Victoria Strouse to write the screenplay. She later said, ""It was always collaborative with Andrew, but really the screenwriting was me. Of course, Andrew would do passes, and he and I would brainstorm a lot together and then we would bring it to the group of story artists. People would weigh in and share ideas."" She pointed to Dory's forgetfulness as a challenge when writing the script, adding, ""You don't realize until you sit down to write a character who can't remember things how integral memory is to absolutely everything we do, and that's what creates a narrative that people can follow. When a main character can't self-reflect and can't tell a story, that character is very difficult to design because she can't really lead. To get her to be able to lead and to get an audience to be able to trust her was the hardest thing to do.""
The fictional Marine Life Institute depicted extensively in the film is based on the production team's research trips to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the Marine Mammal Center and the Vancouver Aquarium.
The film's ending was revised after Pixar executives viewed Blackfish, a 2013 documentary film which focuses on the dangers of keeping orcas in captivity. Initially, some of the characters were to end up in a SeaWorld-like marine park, but the revision gave them an option to leave.
Angus MacLane was one of the first people to whom Stanton revealed his idea for the sequel. Together, with Bob Peterson, they discussed about different ideas for places Dory would visit during her journey — one of those ideas was the touch pool sequence. Later, during the Brave (2012) wrap party, Stanton invited MacLane to join him in his first co-directing duty. Stanton described MacLane's role as a ""jack of all trades"", particularly utilizing his experience in animation and story, as well as in production, having created a few short films himself.
In August 2015, at Disney's D23 Expo, it was announced that Hayden Rolence would voice Nemo, replacing Alexander Gould from the first film, whose voice had deepened since reaching adulthood (Gould voiced a minor character in the sequel instead). At the D23 expo they also announced that Ed O'Neill would be the voice of Hank.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol._2,"By August 2014, Gunn had ""some ideas listed, but nothing for sure"" in terms of songs to include in Quill's Awesome Mix Vol. 2 mixtape, for which he felt ""a little pressure"" due to the positive response to the first film's soundtrack. Gunn added, ""But I feel like the soundtrack in the second one is better."" By June 2015, Gunn had chosen all of the songs and built them into the script, calling Awesome Mix Vol. 2 ""more diverse"" than the first one, with ""some really incredibly famous songs and then some songs that people have never heard."" Tyler Bates was confirmed to score the film by August 2015, returning from the first film. As with Guardians of the Galaxy, Bates wrote some of the score first so Gunn could film to the music, as opposed to Bates scoring to the film. Recording for the score occurred in January 2017 at Abbey Road Studios. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Awesome Mix Volume 2, along with the film score album composed by Bates, were released on April 21, 2017. A cassette version of Awesome Mix Volume 2 was released on June 23, 2017, while a deluxe-edition vinyl LP featuring both Awesome Mix Volume 2 and Bates' score was released on August 11, 2017. ", ,

The Dark Knight Rises,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises,"In an interview in October 2010, composer Hans Zimmer confirmed that he would be returning to score The Dark Knight Rises. James Newton Howard was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of Inception would make him seem like a ""third wheel"". Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores but explained that he wanted to go in a ""completely different direction"" for Bane's theme.
The film features a prevalent chant of the phrase ""Deshi Basara"". In November 2011, Zimmer crowdsourced online audio recordings of the chant to be used in the film's score. When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, ""The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing. We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind.""
Like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, the film's main theme consists of just two notes repeated, representing Batman's pain and guilt. Many times is also reprised in small parts ""Molossus"", Batman's main action theme in the trilogy. ", ," On July 6, 2012, Warner Bros. held a special IMAX screening of The Dark Knight Rises for more than one hundred reporters and critics. However, technical issues with the computer device synchronizing the sound and picture forced the studio to postpone the screening by a day. The film later premiered on July 16 at the AMC Lincoln Square Theater in New York City, followed by a European premiere on July 18 at Leicester Square in London, England. The film was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 19, and was later released in North America and the United Kingdom on July 20. "

Their strategy involved merchandise releases, a global publicity tour, the creation of mock websites about Zubrowkan culture, and trailers highlighting the cast's star power. One of their most significant marketing tactics, instructional videos detailing the creation of desserts mirroring Mendl's baked goods, used fan footage submitted to the producers for TV-commercial spots on cooking networks. In conjunction with their collaboration with Anderson, Prada showcased its capsule collection of custom luggage from in-store displays at the Berlin flagship store.
The Grand Budapest Hotel was released in France on February 26, 2014, preceding the film's global rollout.
